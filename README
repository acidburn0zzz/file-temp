== Description
   The file-temp library is an alternate way to handle tempfile generation.

== Requirements
   ffi 0.5.0 or later

== Synopsis
   require 'file/temp'

   fh = FileTemp.new
   fh.puts "hello"
   fh.close # => Tempfile automatically deleted

   fh = FileTemp.new(false)
   fh.puts "world"
   fh.close # => Tempfile still on your filesystem

== Installation
=== Rubygems
   gem install file-temp
   
=== Standard Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install

== Motivation
   Ruby's tempfile.rb is overwrought and susceptible to race conditions. This
   This library uses your system's native tmpfile() or mkstemp() functions
   instead of trying to handle race conditions manually via pure Ruby.
   
   This library is also more secure because it restricts file permission via
   umask() for files created with mkstemp().

== Other libraries
   I am aware of Cian Synnott's ruby-stemp project. However, I don't like the
   interface, it's GNU-centric (which causes portability issues), and Cian
   has disabled all the trackers and mailing lists on the RubyForge project
   site, as well as online SCM access. So, if he doesn't want feedback, I'm
   not going to waste time with it.

== MS Windows
   You will need to use the mingw build in order to use this library.
